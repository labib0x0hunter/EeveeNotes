4-Week Roadmap: Mastering Threads in C (POSIX Threads)
WEEK 1 — Foundations: Threads & Memory Model
Goal: Understand how threads work, stack, sharing, creation, and lifecycle.
Concepts to Learn
What is a thread?
Process vs thread
POSIX threads overview
pthread_create, pthread_join, pthread_exit
Thread function signatures
Passing arguments to threads
Returning values from threads
Thread-local storage (__thread or pthread_key_t)
Resources
TLPI (The Linux Programming Interface) – Chapters on Threads
POSIX Threads Tutorial — Lawrence Livermore Lab (free PDF)
GeeksForGeeks: POSIX Threads Basics (quick reference)
Mini Projects (Do all):
Spawn 10 threads printing their ID.
Vector addition using threads (split array into N chunks).
Compute sum of N numbers using multi-threading.
Thread-local counter vs shared counter (observe race).
Outcome: You fully understand thread creation, joining, stack, arguments.

WEEK 2 — Synchronization Primitives
Goal: Learn every core primitive that protects shared state.
Concepts
Mutex (pthread_mutex_t)
Lock/unlock
Deadlocks
Re-entrant vs non-reentrant mutex
Contention impact
Condition Variables (pthread_cond_t)
Waiting/signaling
Blocking & waking up threads
Producer–consumer pattern
Semaphores
sem_wait, sem_post, sem_init
Binary semaphore
Counting semaphore
Read-Write Locks
pthread_rwlock_t
When to use RW-lock instead of mutex
Barriers
pthread_barrier_t
Thread phase synchronization
Resources
TLPI — Synchronization Chapters
MIT 6.824 notes on concurrency (conceptual)
POSIX man pages (man pthread_cond_wait, etc.)
Projects
Producer–Consumer queue (Mutex + Condvar)
Reader–Writer lock example:
Many readers, few writers on shared data.
Semaphore-based job counter
Barrier: wait for 10 threads to compute partial work
Outcome: You will fully understand how real systems manage shared state.

WEEK 3 — Real Concurrency Patterns
Goal: Know how modern systems architecture uses threads in reality.
Patterns to study and implement
Thread Pool (your current project)
Task queue
N worker threads
Condition variable for wakeups
Fan-Out / Fan-In
Threads compute tasks
Main thread aggregates results
Pipeline Pattern
Stage1 → Stage2 → Stage3
Each stage = a thread + queue
Asynchronous Tasks using pthread + future
Thread that returns a result later
pthread_join retrieves value
Work Stealing (Conceptual)
Basic intro to schedulers
Only conceptual, no need to implement
Resources
Intel Threading Building Blocks Docs (conceptual)
Linux kernel threads documentation (conceptual exposure)
Your own thread-pool implementation
Projects
Complete your thread pool
Concurrent Logger (worker handles log messages)
Mini-pipeline:
Thread1: read file
Thread2: count words
Thread3: output result
Outcome: You now think in systems patterns, not low-level APIs.

WEEK 4 — Advanced & Real-World Systems
Goal: Understand complex topics used in databases, runtimes, kernels.
Topics
Lock-Free & Atomics
C11 atomic types
Compare-and-Swap (CAS)
Memory ordering basics
Implement lock-free stack (simple)
Thread Scheduling
Linux scheduler basics
CPU affinity (pthread_setaffinity_np)
Thread priorities
Thread Pools in Large Systems
Nginx worker model
Redis I/O thread model
Database thread models (MySQL/InnoDB)
Deadlocks & Race Detection Tools
Valgrind Helgrind
ThreadSanitizer (clang)
Resources
C11 Atomic operations tutorial
Linux Kernel Documentation on RCU (conceptual)
Concurrency chapter from Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective (CS:APP)
Projects
Lock-free stack or queue using atomics
Parallel file processing with thread pool
Thread benchmark:
Increase thread count
Measure performance
Observe scheduler behavior
Outcome: You are ready to build multi-threaded servers, databases, and tools in C.

Final Capstone Project (End of Week 4)
Build a mini multi-threaded HTTP server:
Features:
Main thread accepts connections
A thread pool handles requests
Shared log with mutex
Each worker:
Parse request
Serve static file
Log request
This project activates:
threads
mutex
condvar
queue
pipeline
I/O multiplexing (optional)
thread pool
real-world concurrency design
This is exactly how early versions of Nginx/Apache worked.
