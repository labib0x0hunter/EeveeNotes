###Pointer
---
ChatGpt roadmap to learn pointer in C
---

STAGE 1 — MEMORY MODEL & BASICS
Concepts:
How variables are stored (stack vs static vs heap)
What an address is; how pointers store addresses
& (address-of), * (dereference)
Pointer types: int*, char*, void*
Null pointer, wild pointer, dangling pointer
Practice:
Print addresses of variables
Use int* and char* to modify values indirectly
Write small examples: swap using pointers
Mini-Task:
Build a “memory inspector” program that prints addresses and values for a few variables.

STAGE 2 — POINTER ARITHMETIC
Concepts:
Pointer increment/decrement
Scaling by type size (ptr + 1 depends on sizeof(type))
Traversing arrays using pointers
Arrays vs pointers difference (int arr[] vs int *ptr)
Practice:
Implement strlen, strcpy, memcpy using only pointer arithmetic
Iterate through integer arrays without indexing
Mini-Task:
Write an array iterator that takes a pointer to base, element size, and count, and prints elements.

STAGE 3 — POINTERS & FUNCTIONS
Concepts:
Passing pointers to functions
const correctness (const int *p, int *const p)
Double pointers int **
Dynamic 2D arrays using pointers-to-pointers
Practice:
Implement dynamic matrix creation using int**
Write functions that modify multiple variables using double pointers
Mini-Task:
Implement a dynamic table: create rows, add values, free it properly.

STAGE 4 — POINTERS & THE HEAP
Concepts:
malloc, calloc, realloc, free
Ownership and lifetime
Memory leaks vs dangling pointers
Align pointers with sizeof and alignment rules
Practice:
Allocate arrays dynamically
Write custom resize functions for arrays
Detect memory leaks with valgrind
Mini-Task:
Implement your own dynamic array type like C++ vector<int>.

STAGE 5 — STRINGS & CHAR POINTERS
Concepts:
String as char*
Immutable string literals vs mutable buffers
Buffer overflows and bounds checking
Practice:
Implement your own strtok, strdup, atoi
Validate input to avoid overflow
Mini-Task:
Build a simple tokenizer using only pointers.

STAGE 6 — COMPLEX POINTER DECLARATIONS
Concepts:
Function pointers
Example: int (*f)(int, int)
Arrays of pointers
Pointers to arrays
Typedef for readability
Callback functions
Practice:
Implement callback-based sorting (like qsort)
Use function pointer arrays for a command dispatcher
Mini-Task:
Create a “plugin” system: store function pointers in a table and call them dynamically.

STAGE 7 — LOW-LEVEL POINTER APPLICATIONS
Concepts:
Struct pointers and ->
Offset calculations, offsetof
Casting pointers (void*, char*)
Memory layout, padding, alignment
Practice:
Implement a packed struct and examine its binary layout
Parse a custom binary file format using pointer casts
Mini-Task:
Build a simple binary serializer/deserializer for a struct.

STAGE 8 — ADVANCED PATTERNS
Concepts:
Smart pointer patterns in C (manual refcounting)
Pointer tagging (low bits)
Memory pools and arenas
Implementing buffers with pointer cursors
Practice:
Build an arena allocator using one large malloc
Perform pointer bump allocation
Mini-Task:
Implement a log-based allocator that returns aligned blocks.

STAGE 9 — SYSTEM PROGRAMMING WITH POINTERS
Concepts:
Pointers in system calls (buffers to read, write)
struct sockaddr* in networking
Pointers in file I/O and mmap
Accessing hardware-like memory through pointers (only in OS-level code)
Practice:
Implement a small TCP client using pointer-based buffers
Implement your own getline using realloc + pointers
Use mmap to create a memory-backed file, navigate with pointers
Mini-Task:
Build a tiny key-value store where both data and index are pointer-based structures.

STAGE 10 — CAPSTONE POINTER PROJECT
Implement a minimal storage engine in C:
malloc/mmap-based pages
pointer arithmetic to navigate pages
pointer-to-struct parsing
serialization/deserialization
dynamic resizing
free-lists or pointer-based indexes
This consolidates everything: alignment, pointer math, dynamic memory, casts, function pointers, and buffer management.
